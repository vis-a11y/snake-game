## ✨ Features

- **Classic Snake gameplay** — eat food, grow longer, avoid walls and yourself
- **Progressive difficulty** — game speed increases every 50 points
- **Score & High Score tracking** — high score is persisted via `localStorage`
- **Live timer** — tracks how long you've survived each session
- **Responsive layout** — adapts to different screen sizes (mobile-friendly)
- **Smooth animations** — pulsing food, glowing snake, and CSS transitions throughout

## 🕹️ Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Arrow Up` | Move Up |
| `Arrow Down` | Move Down |
| `Arrow Left` | Move Left |
| `Arrow Right` | Move Right |

> The snake cannot reverse directly into itself (e.g., pressing Left while moving Right is ignored).

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Board Initialization
The game board is a CSS Grid dynamically sized based on the container's pixel dimensions and a fixed block size of `40×40px` with a `4px` gap. The grid is rebuilt on window resize.

### Game Loop
A `setInterval`-driven loop runs every `gameSpeed` ms (starting at `400ms`). Each tick:
1. Moves the snake head in the current direction
2. Checks for wall or self-collision → Game Over
3. Checks if food was eaten → grow, update score, maybe increase speed
4. Re-renders the board by toggling CSS classes on grid cells

### Difficulty Scaling
Every time the score reaches a multiple of **50**, the interval is reduced by **10ms** (down to a minimum of **50ms**), making the snake faster.

### Persistence
High score is saved to `localStorage` under the key `"highScore"` and restored on page load.
